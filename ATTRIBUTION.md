## Original Project

This repository is a **Windows-optimized fork** of the original project:

**[quick-data-mcp](https://github.com/disler/quick-data-mcp)** by **[@disler](https://github.com/disler)**

### Original Project Details
- **Repository:** https://github.com/disler/quick-data-mcp
- **Author:** [@disler](https://github.com/disler)
- **Purpose:** MCP server for data analytics with Claude Code
- **Innovation:** Universal data analytics for any JSON/CSV structure
